Bash commands 
Bash: It is a command line interpreter language that lets you interact with operating system 
When you open a terminal what you basically see is a prompt and then you can give it instructions to operating to execute .
The job of the shell or Command line interface is to understand or interpret the promt that we give as user and then it is executed by the kernel. 

ls -l : list and details of all the directories 
ls -r : list of all the subdirectories
